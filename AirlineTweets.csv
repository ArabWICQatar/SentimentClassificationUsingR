@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.,negative
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.,negative

@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.,negative
@united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service?,negative
@united She üëè won't üëè be üëè at üëè my üëè wedding üëè. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?,negative
@united Brothers luggage was lost on Copa Airlines Flight 635. He's competing Sunday for the 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup. Please help,negative
@united On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy,negative
@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?,negative
"@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with ""issues""...",negative
@united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on?,negative
@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats,negative
@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats,negative
"@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?",negative
@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow,negative
@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane,negative
@united no u don't,negative
"@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service",negative
@united Stuck in this airport 12 hours in standbys cuz the pilot showed up Late Flight in PJs &amp; i missed my connectin flight. PJ's I TELL U! #NYFW,negative
@united if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.,negative
@united it most certainly was not.,negative
@united trying to book flight w/miles. Was on hold for 50m before I gave up. Need to get 6 on same flight using two diff # and pay 4 1tix,negative
"@united THAT'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you're not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain",negative
@united y not? You're the reason we're in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry.,negative
"@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary",negative
"@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!",negative
"@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours",negative
@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer,negative
"@united ""most likely"" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks.",negative
@united tell me something I don't know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea,negative
@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally,negative
@united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.,negative
@united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh,negative
@united where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost,negative
"@united assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at?",negative
@united when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together!,negative
@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!,negative
@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?,negative
"@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice",negative
@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja,negative
@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.,negative
"@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!",negative
@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!,negative
"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?",negative
"@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough",negative
@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac,negative
"@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information.",negative
"@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar.",negative
@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.,negative
@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united,negative
@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...,negative
@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.,negative
@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.,negative
@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5,negative
@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.,negative
"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7",negative
@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw,negative
@united you guys suck!,negative
"@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.",negative
@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..,negative
"@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember",negative
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.,negative
@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M,negative
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.,negative
"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?",negative
"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?",negative
"@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks",negative
@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag,negative
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united,negative
@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.,negative
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.,negative
@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?,negative
"@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int‚Äôl leg, now I‚Äôm sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go",negative
"@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks",negative
"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL",negative
"Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks",negative
"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage.",negative
. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful,negative
@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1),negative
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.,negative
@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs,negative
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.,negative
@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.,negative
@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.,negative
"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta",negative
@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!,negative
@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.,negative
@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.,negative
"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA",negative
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!,negative
@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!,negative
@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!,negative
"@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF",negative
"@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE",negative
@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.,negative
@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies,negative
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.,negative
"@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100",negative
@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable,negative
"@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd.",negative
@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.,negative
